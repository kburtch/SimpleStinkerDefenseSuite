- paths mixed up after moving import/export to admin/ folder
- implement grace

- port changes to http_daemon.sh to other daemons

- ping
  - ping greatly slows the responsiveness...we need to defer it to the wash phase
  - ping errors
  - we need "placeholder ip's" as ping is not guaranteed to find the domain
    name.  Placeholder ip's can be checked later, but also cannot be blocked
    since they are not real ip numbers.  Probably already blocked anyway.
  - AllowedUsers line
- whitelist should be broken down
  - i.e. customers, trusted machines
- handling test data (not blocking, washing out (optionally?))
- test with plain text disabled...does it still work?
- import into tables
- database tables, statistics gathering and reports
  - performance stats

- banning escallation

- security patch metrics
  - which patches, when, how recently, how many over time

tail: ‘/var/log/secure’ has been replaced;  following end of new file

- progress bar on sshd blocker sometimes has a phantom newline / erases
  whatever message was there.
- if spar fails with an error, daemon script doesn't abort

- spar unit tests

- other services
  - virus scan on changed files
  - network listener scan
  - error log summaries
- dan notes SNMP interface, etc. must be considered

- numerics.value(...) should probably take universal_string not string
- unable to find record field ken_burtch.member.description
